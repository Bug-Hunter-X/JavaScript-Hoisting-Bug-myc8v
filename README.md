This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in JavaScript related to hoisting. The `bug.js` file contains code that unexpectedly outputs `undefined` due to how JavaScript handles variable declarations. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version to address this issue.  Hoisting is a mechanism where variable declarations (using `var`) are moved to the top of their scope, but assignments remain in place. This can lead to confusion and unexpected results, particularly for developers new to JavaScript.
